# Loop iOS Sample - Connecting to the Loop platform

## Prerequisites:
  * You will need the latest version of XCode (7.3.1 or greater) to run this sample app.
  * You will need to install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

## Build instructions:
These instructions will get you a copy of a Loop sample app that will send a test signal to the Loop platform.

  0. If you havenâ€™t already, signup for a Loop account and create an app on the [Loop Developer Site](https://developer.dev.loop.ms)
  0. Get the sample app
    0. Clone this sample app `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Loop-Sample-Hello-IOS.git`
    0. Open it in XCode
    0. Make a copy of `Config/Keys.example.xcconfig` and call it `Config/Keys.xcconfig`
    0. In the `Keys.xcconfig` file provide values for the `LOOP_APP_ID_PROP` and `LOOP_APP_TOKEN_PROP` using your Loop app id and app token from the dashboard.
    0. Touch the `Hello Loop.xcconfig` file
  0. Create test users in the user dashboard at the [Loop Developer Site](http://www.loop.ms)
  0. In the `Keys.xcconfig` file provide values for the `LOOP_USER_ID_PROP` and `LOOP_DEVICE_ID_PROP` using a test user id and device id from the dashboard.
  0. From the command line in the project directory run `carthage update --platform iOS`
  0. Build an run the app

After this is done, you can create test signals to update the test profile. This is the same mechanism using test signals that the Loop uses when it creates home & work profiles.
